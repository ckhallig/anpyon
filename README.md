Anpyon - Virtual Assistant Exam

This is created using VSCode, w3.css, Serpstack, and Firebase (not really)

To start clone the repo, go to the directory, and enter in terminal: "nodemon app.js" then go to http://localhost:3000/ of your browser

You can interact with it by:
- searching anything on the searchbox
- typing /remind to set reminders (WIP)
- typing /note to create note (WIP)

There's still work to be done like the CRUD of the reminders and the notes, as well as the notification for the user.

Still, thank you for your time checking this web app :)
